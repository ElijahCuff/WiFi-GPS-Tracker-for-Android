# WiFi GPS Tracker for Android
> Log &amp; Map the GPS coordinates of the strongest WiFi signals.      
    
#### What does this help with ?     
This project was designed to provide assistance in Geolocation statistics and to improving your knowledge of local network Locations.    
       
#### History     
It was specifically designed to identify "Evil Twin" WiFi Networks by providing GPS Tracking of the network's location based on the strongest WiFi signal strength.   
    
• The user finds the Evil Twin      
• The user Opens the App to start Signal Tracking     
• The user Gathers the WiFi Network Signal Strength & Current Devices GPS Location        
• The application identifies when the WiFi signal strength has increased and logs the current GPS coordinates into a file on the SD card       
( This activity is sometimes called "WiFi War Driving" )      
• Once you have logged the closest location to the network, you can start to identify the location of the Evil Twin      
• Walk around towards the Evil Twin Network and try to get a full LOCKED LOCATION.   
  
 
A Fully Locked Location would be Above 99% Signal Strength with a Below 4 Metres GPS Accuracy.
 
   
This tells the user they are at least within the GPS coordinates of the device hosting the WiFi network with around 10 metres accuracy.
